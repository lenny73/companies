The engineers at Firefox work on their browser, alongside software and extensions that make people’s browsing experiences safer/more convenient.

Firefox is mostly written in C++, with Javascripts being used for some of the front-end. Mozilla (the company that owns Firefox) has ~1000 full time employees, of which many contribute work to Firefox in some way. Mozilla also has a large community that helps contribute to the browser, with over 1,000 volunteers contributing code, and over 400,000 individual users contributing via bug tracking.
