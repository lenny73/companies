				company throughout the years. These values are reflected in employees’ 
                              decisions and actions every day.

				a.) Gameplay First: the success of the company is tied to the satisfaction 
                                    customers have with the gaming experiences they provide
					- whether the art, programming, or customer support, the goal is to 
                                        make games that are as fun as possible for as many people as 
                                        possible
				
				b.) Commit to Quality: “We seek honest feedback and use it to improve the 
                                    quality of our work…most players won’t remember whether the game 
                                    was late - only whether it was great.”
	
				c.) Play Nice; Play Fair: “We strive to maintain a high level of respect and i
                                     integrity in all interactions with our players, colleagues, and business 
                                     partners.”

				d.) Embrace Your Inner Geek: “Everyone here is a geek at heart…it matters 
                                    that each employee embraces it! Their unique enthusiasm helps to 
                                    shape the fun, creative culture that is Blizzard Entertainment.”

				e.) Every Voice Matters: “Every employee is encouraged to speak up, listen, 
                                    be respectful of other opinions, and embrace criticism as just another 
                                    avenue for great ideas.”
				
				f.) Think Globally: “While respecting the cultural diversity that makes people unique, 
					we strive to grow and support our global gaming community. We also seek the 
					most passionate, talented people in the world to enrich our company and help us 
					forge the future vision of Blizzard Entertainment.”

					players in mind, and setting a strong example of professionalism and excellence 
					at all times.”

				h.) Learn and Grow: “The games industry is ever-changing. Technology improves, 
					techniques change, and design philosophies become outdated…Employees can 
					count on their peers, managers, and the company itself to be supportive and 
					help them gain the knowledge and training they need.”


			—> How do software engineers play a role in making that vision come to fruition?
				—> helping code and maintain “Blizzard Entertainment’s online-game service, 
					Battle.net”, which is one of the largest online-game services in the world and 
					has millions of active players
				—> software engineers help build, update, and manage the games Blizzard wants to 
					create in order to provide entertainment and engagement for and between 
					people (their customers)
				—> the company’s bestselling and award-winning subscription-based massively 
					multiplayer online role-playing game, World of Warcraft, requires frequent 
					updates, content creation, bug fixes, patch notes, weekly maintenance of 
					servers, and handling of personal information for in-game purchases, 
					subscription renewals, customer service, and handling of user-submitted ticket 
					requests
					—> “The game has achieved unprecedented popularity on a global scale, 
						millions of subscribers worldwide. It is available in eleven different 
						languages based on the regions in which it is played,” which requires 
						software engineers to handle localization and translation of in-game text, 
						dialogue, and customer support with players of a variety of ethnic 
						backgrounds and languages.
				—> in 2010, “Blizzard released a band-new version of its acclaimed online gaming 
					service Battle.net, which has been redesigned from the ground up to be the 
					premier online gaming destination for Blizzard gamers, with several 
					enhancements and new features, such as voice communication, cloud file 		
					storage, leagues and ladders, achievements, stat-tracking, and more.”
				—> in South Korea, the StarCraft game series mass popularity “played a major role in 
					the birth of the professional-gaming and game-broadcasting phenomena, as 
					well as serving as one of the key drivers behind the growth of the PC-game-
					room business”.
				—> in 2013, “Blizzard made a long-awaited return to console development by 
					redesigning Diablo III for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 systems”.
					—> software engineers are also tasked with adapting games to other platforms, 
						such as was the case with the game Diablo III. The game’s expansion was 
						adapted to the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Xbox 360 on 
						August 19, 2014.
